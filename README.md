## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on the detection and classification of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using deep learning techniques and computer vision. It leverages real-time image data to recognize hand signs corresponding to the English alphabet (A-Z). The system is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, built on top of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- ASL static alphabet recognition
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
- Training and validation with accuracy and loss plots
- Model evaluation on test data
- Real-time prediction ready (if webcam integration is extended)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images representing ASL gestures for each letter of the alphabet. Each class (A-Z) contains hundreds of grayscale images of hand gestures.

> **Note**: You may need to download or prepare the dataset separately if not included in this repo.

## 🧪 Model Architecture

The CNN used consists of:

- Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Softmax Activation for classification

### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~99% on training data
- **Loss Curve** and **Accuracy Curve** are plotted to monitor overfitting

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/asl-sign-language-detector.git
cd asl-sign-language-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
# Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook ASL.ipynb
```

Or convert the notebook to script for CLI usage:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script ASL.ipynb
python ASL.py
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time prediction using webcam (OpenCV)
- Expand dataset with more lighting and skin tone variations
- Implement transfer learning for better generalization
- Add support for dynamic gestures and phrases
